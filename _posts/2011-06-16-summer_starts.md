With the end of a very inconsequential last couple of days of school, I am finally free for the summer, which means tons of new hacks. First I will rest, then I will code. With luck and perseverance I'm hoping to turn my code into money that I can use to build all of the projects that I've been planning this past school year.

Today I tired myself out trying to take a bite out of my piles of junk that have taken over my room and the attic in my house, but it's very slow going. Once I am done the monumental task of cleaning it all up and organizing it all I should have a nice work-space to get everything done. I snapped some pictures of the mess before I started and I'll snap some more after I am done so the difference can be seen, hopefully it will be a large change because I'm tired of wading through stabby metal every time I need to find a part.
