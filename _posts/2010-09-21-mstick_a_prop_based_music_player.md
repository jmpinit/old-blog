All sorts of things can be done to improve this early version of the MStick music player, especially because it is a rough project by design. Here is a list of the top improvements that I think could be easily made:

1. Add the accelerometer of course. I need a way to control it other than toggling the power.
2. Write a gesture-control object to utilize the accelerometer fully.
3. Etch a PCB so that the overall size is much smaller and it is much more physically resilient.
4. Switch to a surface-mount Propeller, power regulator, and audio amplifier to reduce the size of the player even further.
5. Use a rechargeable battery for power; 9v's get very expensive very fast.
6. Create a docking station for nightly recharging and file syncing.
7. Mill a case for it out of acrylic or some other resilient material. Might be a good excuse to try a custom manufacturing service for the first time, which is something that I have wanted to do for a while.
