Starting today I will begin posting articles about the projects that I completed and documented before creating this blog. They will be clearly marked as old projects and I will put them in the relic category. There are quite a few of them so I won't be writing new explanations of them all, mostly I will be copying the explanations that I already wrote for them originally. Hopefully putting all of my projects in one place will make it much easier for people to see what I have done.

I will make their publishing date the same as what it originally was, so they will show up at the bottom of the list.
