From my old hackniac blog.

For Christmas this year I received this little toy called the "YadaYadaYada" that lets you record a short sample of sound and then play it back while pitch bending it in real time. It is a lot of fun to play around with, and my brothers and I spent hours pretending to be robots and helicopters, using it for our sound effects. After a while I realized that I could probably build something similar but with more capabilities using some parts lying around in my piles of junk.

The goal is to make a little microcontroller-based device that can record audio and then play it back while modifying it in real time. It should be pocket sized and able to run on batteries for long periods of time. A simple keypad could allow it to play sounds musically. Possibly a display could be set up to allow a person to modify the sample in specific ways. The last requirement is that it should be fun to play with :D.

[edit: this never turned into anything]
