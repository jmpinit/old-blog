I have toyed with writing diaries for a long time, and I have many examples of past failures at them lying around. I always started with the romantic notion of one day being able to look back on who I am today but with perspective, and a sharp distrust for my memory. Every attempt was earnest and I was always able to keep it up for a few weeks at least, but inevitably I would fail to take the time to record my thoughts and the attempt would decay.

Recently I discovered a much better approach to solving the root problem that has led to all my failed diaries. I want to feel like I have not wasted my time, so I want to know exactly what I have accomplished and when I accomplished it. By writing down only my concrete accomplishments a diary project works out much better. Instead of spending time cataloging my thoughts during my work I only catalog the work once it is finished. The list that comes out reassures me that I have spent my time wisely, and provides a way of sparking my own memory to remember the pertinent details to each endeavor.

Even with this different way of recording my time alive I still need a place to put the recording. I could write it down on paper or type it into the computer, but those methods are not personal or even practical enough for me. What I want is an accomplishment box, a device of my own construction to provide a safe place to forever record what I have done with my life. It makes sense to me that the thing to hold my time should be born out of that time it is keeping.

I am imagining a relatively simple machine. Able to record text descriptions of my accomplishments both to paper, disk, and cloud. Something large and clunky and tangible. If only I can find the time to construct it.
