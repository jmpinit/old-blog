No no no. Unfortunately no. My [ersat project](http://www.hackniac.com/blog/2012/01/07/ersat-teaser/) has been on the rocks for the past month (or two?) because of the recent intensifying of the helter-skelter pitter-patterings of my life. However, today marks the start of a new stage in the project, in a completely new direction.

<!--more-->

I have a sensor module constructed, and that's about it. There are chunks of a power module and a prototype command module, but chunks don't make a satellite and I've got to present in less than a month! Hardware development is slow, and finishing a physical ersat in the time remaining is now hopeless. So instead of giving up I'm fighting back with software. In the next month I'm going to concoct an amalgam of the hardware I've already got and pieces of software that I've been cooking for parallel projects over the past year. The end result will be a strange, fully interactive simulation of a live ersat network (which itself is an approximation of a real satellite network).

It's all just now coming together, so I'll end here for now with a picture that will hopefully convey the essence:
