My [ersats](http://www.hackniac.com/posts/ersat-teaser.html) project went very well. I learned very much, created a lot of interesting things, and put what I learned into a single demonstrable end product that I managed to get credit for in my last year of highschool (last year). I left for the West after school ended and summer began with the hope that I would return to the project and continue it. Unfortunately things did not go as I had hoped.

The end-product I had demonstrated in my presentation at school was Black-Pepper, the first working ersat. It was designed to show off as many of the concepts involved in the project as possible. Challenges like building something from trash, harvesting energy from surroundings, networking with poor infrastructure, dynamically changing processing power to meet the needs of a changing environment, and various others were overcome with some success in this machine. And it was beautiful (to me). Something that I was very proud of, and something that made me very happy whenever I looked at it.

I took with me to MIT. I attached it to the ceiling of my room and fired it up. It wowed a few visitors. Then it exploded all over the floor. It turns out hot glue is terrible for long-term resiliency. It got brittle and fell apart.

The emotional fallout was bad. I felt like I had gotten a disfiguring injury. Black Pepper was a physical object that I could point to and say, "this is what I am capable of. I made that with my own head and hands." I had lived inside of the world that I had built that machine in for a very long time. Immense effort was poured into it over many months. And then it was gone and all I have to show for it are a few bad pictures taken from my phone.

## Hacking and Emotions - motivation and ambition

Black Pepper is dead physically, but has entered a new life as a nucleation point in my head for understanding what I'm doing with my life and why I am doing it. I'm spending my life hacking because hacking for me is a deeply emotional activity. I think that many people who strive to make beautiful things have this kind of relationship with their creations, whether they be machines, buildings, or more traditional works of art like literature, painting, and theater. It's not something that you decide to do. It's something that you need to do, and you'll feel terrible if you're kept from doing it.

That property of deep emotional meaning that my projects have for me is what makes them the center of my life. It's also likely what makes me valuable to other people, because it gives me two psychological advantages for free: **motivation and ambition**. It's said over and over that these are attributes people should have if they want to be successful. You need to throw yourself into your work. You need to believe in yourself to keep trying until you succeed. You need tenacity, which seems to be the distilled combination of all of these beneficial properties.

Black Pepper exploded, but my brain is just going to keep doing what it does and tug me along. Ersats will continue to be developed.
