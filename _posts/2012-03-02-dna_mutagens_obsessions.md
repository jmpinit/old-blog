I'm currently beset by unfortunately massive volumes of school work. The little time on the side that I have had has been devoted to making incremental additions to my ersat project. However, today that routine was not followed. I have been reading Silent Spring, which is the book that in large part sparked the environmental movement, admittedly for a school assignment. I reached a chapter about the genetic damage that certain chemicals are able to create in plants and animals - and very suprisingly, was deeply inspired.

In particular it was the word "mutagen" that did it. A mutagen is simply any chemical that can change the genetics of a form of life. It creates mutations. The word immediately brought back strong memories of projects I have done relating to genetics from long ago to the present. The subject fascinates me and has inspired many of my favorite creations (ironically though, the greater subject of biology bores me to death). I started thinking along the same lines that led to those creations, but in the context of the things that I am creating now. The lines of thought quickly converged on the hazy outline of a new project.

Unfortunately it is little different than most of my other projects inspired by genetics, and unfortunately I have no time to work on a new project. But that's no fun! It's always that state of things. Where has my sense of ambition gone? I'm taking this new project and running with it. The time needed to nourish it will either manifest itself as ooze from between the activities currently stacked tightly in my days, or it will assert its life and exert force enough to make room.

So this marks the taking-hold of a new seed of obsession. The details of the project are irrelevant for now (although their future disclosure is a sure thing). My intention here is to capture some inkling of the form my creativity takes. The urge to write this came out of the joy that burst out of that inspiration I happened upon while reading. I do enjoy that book, but when I remembered my old ideas and started churning them anew it was like something colorful finally bloomed out of the dead and colorless weight of it.

This intensity is born of contrast. Lately my inspiration and ambition have been sapped by work done for the sake of others. My schoolwork does not challenge me, but it does not disagree with me either. I've just sat complacent in the comfy chair in my room every day for hours obediently evaluating calculus expressions and writing essays, and generally being a good student, but going through the motions for the sake of my teachers and parents and not myself. I argue with myself that it's doing me good. It is doing me good. But I don't feel that it is and I know why. Making my obsessions settle for the scraps of time left by these other activities, foisted on me, makes me feel like I'm running in place. This homework and schoolwork is definitely giving me new tools. But these are tools other people think I will need. These are tools other people think they need to give to me; force onto me.

I don't like others helping me against my will. Everything I do that is worthwhile starts with me. I take an interest. I conceive my creations. I figure out how to accomplish them. I savor the meaning that goes along with them. I burn my own fuel, have my own motivation, and I don't want a transplant from anyone else - however kindly it is offered. The only successes I have had that count have fed on only my own energy from happy birth to timely death.

The intensity with which I feel this, whether due to legitimacy or my youth, explains for me my current dissatisfaction with school. For you I hope it explains why, and how, I am able to create the things that I show here. It's why I describe my projects as a reason for living and my true passion. With luck I will keep the ability to love them this strongly, but steps must be taken to protect it into the future. Especially now as I ready myself for the first big transition towards independence that I will experience in my life. So I'll keep up a frenzy of building my machines and writing down my ideas - creating - and everything else can feed on the ooze from that.
