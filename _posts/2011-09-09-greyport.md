# Automatic Hacking Multitool

![](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/greyport/greyportbanner.png)

Greyport's goal was to be a pocket-sized automated electronics hacking tool. After being wired in to a target system, like a door access panel, it would probe the circuit and map out possible attack vectors for the user to exploit. Basic voltage, current, and resistance measurements would be combined with checks for digital signaling in a wide variety of formats to give the user an overview of the system. Using information from the scan the user would write a short program in a special scripting language (on Greyport) to actually carry out the exploit and take control of the target.

While the ambition of realizing the autohacking devices seen in bad Hollywood movies was unlikely to be fulfilled, the basic functionality that Greyport offered is still valuable. It was comparable to an Arduino connected to a laptop, with improvements in ease-of-use, portability, and robustness. Ideally it would serve as a multimeter, protocol sniffer, and hardware prototyping platform at the same time in a form-factor small enough to be carried in a pocket all day.

## Development

Greyport was my most ambitious project during high school. It came about because I was looking for cool things to do with microcontrollers, had a soft spot for bare-metal programming, and liked messy electronics hacking. Even though I had been doing lots of projects with microcontrollers for more than a year before starting Greyport, I really had no clue how to achieve the goal I set for the project. But I figured that if I set the target really high, even a miss would result in something cool.

If I count the time that I spent working on the ideas leading up to the official project, then I worked on Greyport for more than two years. Initially the idea had been to make something akin to a mashup between a gameboy, calculator, and cell phone. I called it "Barnacle" because it was a device designed to have a parasitic relationship with other electronics. It would have a clamshell form-factor, with a keyboard on the bottom and an LCD screen on the top - very similar to a calculator or a cell phone. But the design also called for a large array of IO devices, like a parallel port, TTL/CMOS serial, infrared transciever, Bluetooth, and even Wifi. Having done little more than make big messy handheld gaming devices before working on Barnacle there was almost no way that I could actually build what I wanted. But I still learned a lot trying. In particular, I learned about making PCBs for the first time. Here is 15 year-old me holding two copies of the first small form-factor keyboard design for Barnacle / Greyport:

A very nice acquantance at Oklahoma University got my design manufactured on the PCB mill in his lab and mailed to me for free. Unfortunately I had no idea what I was doing and promptly made a horrible non-working mess:

## Results

The end of the project was marked by a presentation I made at school (I had turned it into an "independent study" for some credit) where I used Greyport to "hack" a robot toy. At the time the Greyport hardware was an Atmega32 connected to a [homemade keyboard](http://owentrueblood.me/old/2012/09/04/greyport_keyboard.html) and a Nokia 3310 LCD screen. The keyboard and the breadboard holding the microcontroller and LCD were screwed onto a piece of wood (actually a slice of a 100 year old barn), so the whole thing looked sort of ridiculous. But I went up in front of a group of my teachers, took apart the robot toy, attached alligator clips to key parts of the toy's PCB, and demonstrated that a program I written on Greyport could take control of the robot toy. They expressed amazement, but I'm pretty sure they had no idea what was going on.

The code powering that demonstration is [up on Github](https://github.com/jmptable/greyport). Without the hardware it's not directly useful, but it was written from scratch by a kid who had no idea what he was doing, so I'm sure it contains some gems worth looking at.
