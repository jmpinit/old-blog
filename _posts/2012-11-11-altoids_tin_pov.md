I found this old POV project that I worked on. Uses an Attiny2313 in an Altoids tin. I particularly like the way that I modified the case for the LEDs to show through. There is a slit cut and then the sides were bent inwards so the sharp edges are not facing out and the LEDs have their own little recessed slot.
