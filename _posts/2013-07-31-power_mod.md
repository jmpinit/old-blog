New EEE PC 1005HA Power Connector
=================================

This is the gross battery charger connector for my netbook. I repaired it more than a dozen times until it finally was unworkable. I needed to charge the battery so I added a new connector to the computer.

Here's the nasty old splice on the charger wire.

I cut it out and made a nice new straight splice:

And stole a power connector from an EEE PC 701 motherboard:

Then I encased it in a plastic enclosure I found in my parts bin and wired it to the original connector of my netbook.

Here it is booted up without a battery, running power across the new connector:

And here's what it looks like all buttoned up:

A little silly looking, but very functional. Much better than it was originally, in my opinion. There is a lot more room for flexing so the connector should stop wearing out so quickly. And maybe surprisingly, it doesn't get in the way, because it's within the side profile of the netbook.
