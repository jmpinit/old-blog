SYNTH
=====

Allowed a (pseudo) waveform to be edited and then played out over the link port by sending the values to an assembly program running on a timer interrupt that played the values as audible frequencies. Made some interesting sounds, but was not very controllable. Also, any edits to the code would change the timing and consequently how the whole thing sounded.

SOUND
=====

Mimics an audio waveform by drawing random length vertical, centered lines.

SLIDERS
=======

Maybe the most complicated program that I ever wrote in Mimas (on-calculator assembler). Purpose was to serve as the basis for a serious calculator synthesizer/tracker program. But after I got the slider interface working I ran into some forgotten difficulties with the project and stopped.
