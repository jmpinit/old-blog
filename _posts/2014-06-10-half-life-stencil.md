After getting three 4x8' sheets of 1/4" plywood, I cut them into 72 rectangles size 16x12 inches to fit into the Epilog laser cutter upstairs. I wanted to try out a cut with the new material, and making a stencil came to mind as a fun quick test. After a little bit of thought, it occurred to me that the graffiti found in the game Half Life 2 either already is a stencil or would make great ones with a little effort. So a little bit of Google searching later I had a vectorized design in Corel Draw ready to send to the laser cutter. The second attempt produced the results below (the speed was too low for the first attempt so the wood caught fire):

It was a fun tiny project, so maybe more will come?
