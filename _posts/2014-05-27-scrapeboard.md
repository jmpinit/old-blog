# The Scrapeboard

## Origin

It is the end of the school year, and the start of summer. In MIT's East Campus dormatory students are throwing out what they don't need. An immense amount of junk appears throughout the building, free for the taking. Homework is done, so it is the perfect time for silly projects.

I took wood from a disassembled loft, wood screws from the same, wheels from someone's unwanted robot, a skateboard truck with wheels that appeared in the trash, and a broken skateboard deck that a friend was hoarding. I then sat down and made myself a vehicle to more speedily traverse the long straight hallways of E.C.

## Build Quality

Awful.

## Safety

Dangerous. The edges are sharp. There are splinters everywhere. Both ends are effectively spears. The axles randomly shear off when at high speeds.

Within the first 5 minutes of using it the back wheels fell off and I had a painful crash. I had just screwed through the center of the wheels to attach them to the main body, not tightening the screws all the way so the wheels could rotate. My weight and the sharp sides of the screws quickly reamed out the insides of the wheels, so all of a sudden they bound to the screws and sheared off. I fixed it by adding more wheels, and it seems to be more resilient now.
