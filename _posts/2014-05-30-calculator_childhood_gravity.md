#### MORBITS

![MORBITS](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/MORBITS.gif)

N-body gravity simulation. Runs very slowly on a real calculator, but creates pretty patterns with its trails. It was written during AP Physics, It uses the proper math.

#### ORBIT

Glitchy game where you try to fire thrusters in the 4 cardinal directions to control yourself while under the influence of a strong gravitational attraction to a body at the center of the screen.

#### ORBITS

Simulation of many point masses orbiting a central body. None of the point masses are attracted to each other, which is different from MORBITS.
