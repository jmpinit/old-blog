# BIRD

![BIRD](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BIRD.gif)

A quick sketch of a calculator version of an older project I did in Java called [Lineworld](http://owen-t.me/old/2011/12/11/lineworld.html).

# PARTS

![PARTS](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PARTS.gif)

Runs a very simple algorithm: Randomly pick a position on the screen and a direction that is either vertical or horizontal. Then turn pixels black while moving outward from the starting point in the chosen direction until an already-black pixel is hit. Has the nice side-effect of generating black and white images similar to those of Piet Mondrian:

# PUPPY

![PUPPY](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PUPPY.gif)

Drops a little ASCII-art puppy from the sky and then has him move and jump around the screen randomly.

# PLASMA

![PLASMA](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PLASMA.gif)

Draws a simple static plasma effect on the screen. A simple modular thresholding of the sum of two sine functions over the X and Y positions, it is a very simple effect to generate.

# SCRUNCH

![SCRUNCH](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SCRUNCH.gif)

A poor effect generated by spacing vertical lines according to a sine function fed a changing value.

# SINEWAVE

![SINEWAVE](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SINEWAVE.gif)

Axe program that scrolls a sinewave. Very simple, but pleasant to watch.

# TILER

![TILER](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/TILER.gif)

Uses the sprite manipulation routines of Axe to pan a field of smiley-face sprites.

# TNPLSM

![TNPLSM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/TINYPLAS.gif)

Tiny plasma is one of my favorite effects, because it takes advantage of the sprite routines of Axe to generate a fast plasma effect with dynamically generated dithered sprites.

# BLASM

![BLASM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BLASM.gif)

A version of TNPLSM that uses a different height function (mix of sines).

# SLWPLASM

![SLWPLASM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SLWPLASM.gif)

Generates a simple plasma effect in a small portion of the screen. Unfortunately the calculator is not fast enough to do a plasma effect across the whole screen without taking advantage of assembly programming (as far as I know).
