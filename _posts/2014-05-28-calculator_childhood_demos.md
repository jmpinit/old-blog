# BIRD

![BIRD](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BIRD.gif)

A quick sketch of a calculator version of an older project I did in Java called [Lineworld](http://owen-t.me/old/2011/12/11/lineworld.html).

# PARTS

![PARTS](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PARTS.gif)

Runs a very simple algorithm: Randomly pick a position on the screen and a direction that is either vertical or horizontal. Then turn pixels black while moving outward from the starting point in the chosen direction until an already-black pixel is hit. Has the nice side-effect of generating black and white images similar to those of Piet Mondrian:

# PUPPY

![PUPPY](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PUPPY.gif)

Drops a little ASCII-art puppy from the sky and then has him move and jump around the screen randomly.

# PLASMA

![PLASMA](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/PLASMA.gif)

Draws a simple static plasma effect on the screen. A simple modular thresholding of the sum of two sine functions over the X and Y positions, it is a very simple effect to generate.

# SCRUNCH

![SCRUNCH](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SCRUNCH.gif)

A poor effect generated by spacing vertical lines according to a sine function fed a changing value.

# SINEWAVE

![SINEWAVE](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SINEWAVE.gif)

Axe program that scrolls a sinewave. Very simple, but pleasant to watch.

# TILER

![TILER](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/TILER.gif)

Uses the sprite manipulation routines of Axe to pan a field of smiley-face sprites.

# TNPLSM

![TNPLSM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/TINYPLAS.gif)

Tiny plasma is one of my favorite effects, because it takes advantage of the sprite routines of Axe to generate a fast plasma effect with dynamically generated dithered sprites.

# BLASM

![BLASM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BLASM.gif)

A version of TNPLSM that uses a different height function (mix of sines).

# SLWPLASM

![SLWPLASM](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/SLWPLASM.gif)

Generates a simple plasma effect in a small portion of the screen. Unfortunately the calculator is not fast enough to do a plasma effect across the whole screen without taking advantage of assembly programming (as far as I know).

# CONTOUR

![CONTOUR](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/CONTOUR.gif)

Created contour plots of nearly arbitrary 3D functions stored in Y= variables. Took forever to run (up to 15 minutes).

# BMAZER

![BMAZER](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BMAZER.gif)

A poor implementation of a recursive maze generation algorithm.

# MAZE

![MAZE](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/MAZE.gif)

Simple binary maze generation algorithm.

# CAST

![CAST](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/CAST.gif)

Wolfenstein-style raycasting. Only partially working. Used Bresenham's line algorithm to cast the rays.

![failed CAST](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/CAST.png)

# CRYSTAL

![CRYSTAL](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/CRYSTAL.gif)

# FLASHER

![FLASHER](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/FLASHER.gif)

Trying to flash the screen very rapidly using an assembly program written in Mimas. Did not work.

# FLUID

![FLUID](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/FLUID.gif)

Fluid simulation. Worked by saving each frame as a Picture variable after simulation to be played back later at a reasonable framerate.

![FLUID](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/FLUID_out.gif)

# GOOP

![GOOP](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/GOOP.gif)

# GRID

![GRID](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/GRID.gif)

Makes a grid for doing 8x8 pixel art.

# HEXPIC

![HEXPIC](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/HEXPIC.gif)

8x8 sprite editor. Output in hex format for sending to common TIBASIC sprite helper programs.

# INVADE

![INVADE](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/INVADE.gif)

Makes a giant random space invader.

# INVADERS

![INVADERS](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/INVADERS.gif)

Fills the screen with random space invaders.

# ISODRAW

![ISODRAW](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ISODRAW.gif)

Assembly program that draws a heightmap using small isometric boxes.

# ISODRW

![ISODRW](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ISODRW.gif)

TIBASIC program that draws a heightmap using small isometric boxes.

# LIQUID

![LIQUID](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/LIQUID.gif)

Fast liquid simulation using Axe.

# RAND

![RAND](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/RAND.png)

Generates a random layout of particles in a Picture variable for use with one of my fluid simulations.

# RAYCAST2

![RAYCAST2 input](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/RAYCAST_in.png)

![RAYCAST2 input](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/RAYCAST2_in.png)

A better raycaster.

# ROAD

![ROAD](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ROAD.gif)

Just flies above a randomly generated road.

# ROOT

![ROOT](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ROOT.gif)

Axe program that draws roots using a cellular automata.

# ROOTS

![ROOTS](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ROOTS.gif)

TIBASIC program that draws roots using a cellular automata.

![ROOTS output](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ROOT_out.png)
# BATTERY

![BATTERY](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/BATTERY.gif)

Certain TI calculators know how to measure the charge in their batteries. This program used a bit of assembly code to let a TIBASIC program read that battery value and draw it in a friendly format on the screen.

# ALLASCII

![ALLASCII](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/calculator_childhood/ALLASCII.gif)
