I was reminded of the concept of chord typing (where many fewer keys are used than on a regular keyboard but multiple keys are pressed at once to type a character) for some reason or another. Now I want to build a keyboard to allow me to learn to do it. I'm mulling over the possibility of making two versions: Â a USB or bluetooth interface for use with regular computers and a version to use with my TI 84+ graphing calculator (for super extremely fast program-writing).

Now that I think about it, why not a bluetooth module for my calculator? Then I just need to make one chord-based keyboard. Hmm...

Edit 1-

A joystick might provide the perfect starting point for a handheld chord-based keyboard. The trigger would be one button and there might already be the three thumb buttons at the top, so it would just require adding three more finger buttons and a controller to have the hardware done. I've definitely got a few good joysticks in my junk pile that could be used for this.
