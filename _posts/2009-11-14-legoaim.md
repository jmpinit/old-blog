From my old hackniac blog

Meeting at my house for my school's robotics club did not go as planned, only one person showed up. We worked on a bot for a bit, but then we drifted into other activities. That day I had rereading a wonderful book that I received for Christmas one year on advanced Lego NXT programming, so I got the old brick out and we got to hacking. We played around with some bluetooth stuff, almost got a simple hack working to hijack other bricks nearby, but sadly I don't own another one of them so we couldn't test it out. At some point we had nothing left to do with it, and after a bit of thinking came up with this crazy project.

I read the section in my NXT programming book about the I2C interface. It occurred to me that I could easily hook a microcontroller to an NXT cable, write some code, and get two way communications going. With that ability the options are almost limitless. I've been doing a lot of stuff with keyboards (synth project), so naturally I wanted to try and hook one up to the NXT using a microcontroller intermediary. I told my idea to my friend and within a few minutes we had set the project goal at nothing less than the functionality of a basic AIM client on the NXT. Technically this project is not really anything as complex as that sounds. The real client sits on a desktop computer. It does all the hard work. The NXT just communicates to it over bluetooth, allowing you to type messages and see replies away from the computer. Might be a nifty thing to have by your bed or on the kitchen counter, but its immediate practicality ends there.

The things that we are creating in this project open a huge variety of possibilities. Easily set up communication between a microcontroller and the NXT allows a huge variety of interface options. Keyboard input opens the possibility of writing programs for the NXT on the actual NXT itself, with no need for a computer. The bluetooth interface code that we have set up makes it easy for complex control programs to be written on a PC for the NXT, and allows the powerful capabilities of a desktop or laptop computer to be funneled into the otherwise limiting environment of the NXT brick.
