The most obvious thing to do is convert the digitizer to serve as a mouse for my computer. It should be easily accomplished using the V-USB library for atmega chips and a small board inside the case of the digitizer with a USB port. Having it show up as a mouse in Windows would let me use it to draw nice pictures and do stuff that requires a lot of control.

Using the board as a playing field for some kind of physical game is an idea that I like. Maybe having the game field be invisible and only revealed by the pen would be fun. The feeling that I got when navigating the menus using only sound as feedback was interesting, something that could be the basis of a fun game.

[edit: I used the Java Robot API to control my mouse with the plotter. It was fun to play with but ultimately not very useful.]
