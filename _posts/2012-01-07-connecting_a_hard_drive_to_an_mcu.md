I've got a few dozen old hard drives just sitting in my junk pile, so over the summer I decided to attempt to interface them with an 8 bit microcontroller. The board above is what I came up with. It has an Atmega32 microprocessor wired up to two headers, which allows it to be plugged into an IDE hard drive.

Creating this board was easy enough, but the software was the challenging part. Finding good information on the IDE specification proved to be difficult, but eventually I found two sources that deal with combining IDE devices and microcontrollers specifically, [here](http://www.retroleum.co.uk/electronics-articles/an-8-bit-ide-interface/)Â and [here](http://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/wesley.html). It turned out that the information was hard to properly implement, and I spent a week working on the project with painfully little progress. Eventually I was able to read some data from a hard drive over the interface and spin up/down the drive, but that was it. I started to lose interest after it proved to be so difficult and unreliable, especially because it was supposed to be a small side project. Maybe in the future I'll take another shot at it and have less of a hard time, but for now the IDE experimentation is finished.
