Project is one year old from the time I wrote this article about it.

I took ceramics class in my senior year in high school and had a cool teacher who let me flex my creative muscles. She was extremelyÂ accommodating. I did this project for my final in her class. It's a musical instrument inspired by some [ceramic pipe percussion instruments](http://www.ninestones.com/muffler.html) that I found on the internet.
The midipus has an Arduino inside capable of generating 3 tones at the same time for output to 3 different speakers. There's one speaker for each "arm".

Midi information gets fed into the Arduino and sounds comes out. It's a very strange creature, and the sounds it makes are not exactly pleasant, but it has a certain character to it that I like. Eventually I had hoped to make it autogenerate music using Markov chains and a genetic algorithm fed sensor information, but time ran short.

It's quite hefty because of its ceramic nature:
