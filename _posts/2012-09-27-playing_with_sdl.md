I am learning how to use SDL. This afternoon I wrote the code that generated the image above. It is a mirrored wireframe height map. On the surface is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life. A bump indicates life and flatness indicates death.

The renderer is my own. I am not using OpenGL, just [SDL_Draw](http://sdl-draw.sourceforge.net/) to draw the lines. I am writing code for a demo based on this. Its code will show up on [my Github](https://github.com/jmptable) sometime soon.
