According to popular opinion a hacker is an evil person. It seems like there is a new story every day about a hacker breaking through some corporation's security and stealing the private information of millions of people. With every new crime there is a wave of fresh hate towards hackers and their ilk. With all of the invective directed towards hackers one would think that they represent the super-villains of this millennium.

And yet 'hacker' is my favorite word for describing who I am. It is a good guess that I am not an evil information thief. So why do I choose 'hacker' if I am asked to pick one word to use to describe myself? I choose it because everything that it represents, except for law-breaking, also represents me perfectly. The spirit of hacking is beautiful, and something that has survived its new popular association with the most modern of crimes. That spirit is what I believe describes why I do what I do most accurately.

Hacking is about freeing things from their original purposes. A hacker works with what he has. A hacker's raw material is not the substance of what is before him, it's the invisible connections within it. With careful study the connections can be dissected and repurposed. That spirit of careful discovery and artfully applied skill is what is so beautiful about hacking, and what I most strongly identify with.

I do not endeavor to break into the databases of corporations or the private files on people's computers, but I am still passionately a hacker at heart. I strive to gaze deeply into the connections between the materials I have to work with, and by doing so get the material to exert the force that I want to apply, rather than applying the force wastefully myself. By using the system to my advantage I make the most of my efforts, and extend my creative reach further as a result. My ability to create is not as special as the hacker spirit that guides my application of it.
