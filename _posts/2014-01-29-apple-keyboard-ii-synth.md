Put Attiny13 microcontroller inside of an Apple II keyboard to make it a synthesizer. The keyboard hardware is really nice, and I pulled several of the old devices out of the trash. But as of 4/5/14 I haven't spent the time to write the code for the microcontroller to be able to read keypresses. It uses a sort of odd polling protocol designed by Steve Wozniac. So it doesn't broadcast all events all the time for me to listen to and decypher. I need to write code from the spec.
