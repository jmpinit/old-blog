### Introduction


In the spirit of the new school year I am starting a new hacking endeavor. With most of my time tied to my local place of learning I will be unable to access my most of my equipment and make progress on any of my normal projects. The only electronic  toy I have to play with during school is my lowly TI-84 plus graphing calculator. To give me something to do during boring classes, breaks, and my lunch period I've contrived this project, dubbed 'Deep Magic', because that is what will be required to complete it.

The inspiration for this project comes from some very special equipment that we have been given to use in my Calculus BC class, a classroom set of TI-Navigators and accompanying software. For those unaware of this Texas Instruments product, the Navigator is a brick of a device that plugs into graphing calculators and allows wireless communications with the teacher's computer as well as all of the other calculators on the network. For the teacher it enables wondrous new powers of Orwellian magic like real-time analysis of how students are  solving problems or even more direct and specific spying on the children who insist on playing games, or programming, when important work is at hand. For me, the system may offer a bountiful playground of low-level network hacking, if only I can find the open window in this particular stinking, badly lit cottage of Texas Instruments hardware.

Normally to find that window I would break out my research skills and my fancy windows-based Z80 assembler to hack together some code for subsequent smashing of that cottage window and pillaging of the goodies inside, but in this instance I am going to take a different route. I want a real challenge, one that I can also work on during school hours. To make it fit those constraints I am altering the environment that I am going to work in.


### The Rules


1. No official (written down) school rules will be broken.

2. The only tool I will use in the hack is my TI 84+ graphing calculator.

3. References will be restricted to the z80 processor instruction set and the TI-84 include file included with the TASM z80 assembler (both printed onto paper so as not to break rule 2).

To be clear, I will not be allowed to use a computer to write code for this hack. I will not have the benefit of a prewritten PC-based assembler for z80 code, or the internet. I will only be able to use the built-in functions of my graphing calculator. This will force me to be very, very clever with my software hacks in assembler and TI BASIC.

I will also not have the benefit of any preexisting knowledge of the technical workings of the Navigators, from the internet or my own head. The cottage will be completely dark to me until I build a flashlight using my hacking skills and carefully direct it into the abyss inside. All forays near the cottage will have to be done in the dead of night (while I am given access to the Navigators in my Calculus class), further increasing the difficulty of the challenge.


### Plan


As I endeavor to MacGyver my way into the Navigator cottage I'll be keeping careful record of my progress. I'm planning on doing a post for the completion of every significant step, and possibly a video as well. It will be slow-going, I only have so long during school to work on this, but progress should be steady since I really have nothing better to do (well, save actually paying full attention to my teachers during class). Maybe I'll find a worthwhile nugget at the end, and maybe not, but it should at least be a fun experience.
