An ancient project. I saw an instructable about making your own CNC like this, and I followed it, but didn't do it quite right. Spent about $100 on steppers, controllers, and other parts. Turned out that the steppers I got were too weak and my method of connecting them to the threaded rod I was using was very poorly conceived (hot glue and shrink wrap tubing). It looks like it could have worked, but it never did. I did one test where I got it to drill a hole in a piece of wood, but that ended in spectacular failure when the wood caught on fire because I didn't have the right kind of bit for the Dremel I was using.

Still, was a fun project to attempt. Maybe I'll try again someday with more success.
