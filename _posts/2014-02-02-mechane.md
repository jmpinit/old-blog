Part of the task of constructing a control board for my team's [Tech Fair](http://techfair.mit.edu/) project. GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/jmptable/mechane) (with a proper explanation). And official blog posts are [here](http://techfair.mit.edu/sr-blog/archives/author/jmptablemit-edu).

This is what I have been spending much of my time on over my [Independent Activities Period](http://web.mit.edu/iap/) at MIT. I did the electrical engineering, firmware programming, and other random tasks for the project. My teammates handled mechanical engineering and web/desktop client development.

Tech Fair is tomorrow!
