Over the years I have hoarded a huge amount of junked toys, computers, appliances, gadgets, and other stuff to have raw material for building things. I didn't start out with a plan for organizing it; I just took over any unused space around my house. Of course my parents did not like that and before long they asked me to confine my mess to our attic. I _mostly_ did, and by now it has taken over everything up there:

I think it is rather impressive. The scene in my attic makes a person take a step back and say, "I think he might need some professional help", assuming that the person didn't trip over the pile and hit their head when they took that step back. The problem is so bad that I finally started considering spending the time needed to organize it. With the magnitude of the task being so large I put a lot of thought into the system to use to keep track of it all. I decided that if I was going to spend the time I might as well go all out and make the system digital. I looked at a lot of different options, mostly software used to organize photographs and inventory for stores. None of it was what I wanted and I didn't find any one system in particular that seemed close enough to my needs to be modified to fit. Having the deficit of attention that I do I decided to start a new project and write my own database software to keep track of all of my junk.


## Rebirth of old project


During the school year I had a programming independent study. Towards the end of it I was given the task of writing a database application to be used by the school for keeping track of teacher in-service hours. It was a horrible experience. Bureaucracy and miscommunication reigned throughout. Eventually the delays imposed by my school in dealing with security restrictions (they wouldn't even tell me the format of the data they wanted my system to be able to import) caused the project to falter out. The only things I came away from it with were a lesson to never take on a project that I feel no love for (if I can manage it), and a rough PHP-based database system.

Upon deciding to come up with a system for keeping track of my junk on my own I took a second look at this failed project. I realized that with a few small modifications it would actually work perfectly for what I wanted. Happy that my huge investment of time, effort, and stress would finally be at least somewhat worthwhile I spent a day making those modifications and tweaking it to my liking. I then waded through my attic and selected an old laptop to be the server. With everything set up to my liking I began the arduous task of organizing and recording all of my junk.


## The System


The homepage for the system allows me to search for a part based on tags and title, list every single item in the database, or add items to the database.

Browsing all of the items is helpful now because I only have my most useful parts in the database, but it might get prohibitively clunky as I add more stuff. When that starts to happen I will hopefully be good at using the search function to find what I need.

I can view the information for an individual item, which includes the name of the place it is located in my house, the row, the column, when it was last taken from its spot, and a description of what it is. Every place that I use to store my organized junk has a whimsical name that I came up with to help me remember which one they are. Right now there is Scatter Hat, Lego Man, and Old Guy, but I plan to add more later. Each storage location is a parts organizers with tons of drawers (hence the row and column information).

## Drawbacks


It takes forever to put all of my parts into the database! I streamlined the input process, but it still requires that I type a description for each part and record where it is stored. With thousands upon thousands of pieces of junk to put into the database the whole process will take a very long time to complete. For now I am just putting in my most useful stuff. Whenever I have spare time I'll add more things to the database so hopefully I'll have most of the stuff I need to access regularly in it by the end of the summer.
