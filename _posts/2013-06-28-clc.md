A blazing-fast command-line calculator that understands Lua and speaks ASCII-art. Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmptable/clc).

Python and bc were the tools that I used before I started writing this. BC is awful because it takes some seconds to launch and exit. It does things in odd ways sometimes. Python is great but it also requires some boilerplate before a basic calculation can be done, and visualizations in the console are not included in the box. I don't want my attention split by pop-up matplotlib windows and I just want to get a flavor for the shape of the math, so ASCII-art is desirable.
