I made this while I was in Washington. I was working on Nibble on that big piece of paper in the picture above, and needed a way to quickly get to my different pens. I had already made a bad pen holding cup (visible in the back on the left) out of an old plastic drink container, but that kept falling over, was annoying to use, and was ugly. I grabbed some cardboard from a toy box laying around and a utility knife, and made myself this pen organizer. I like the way it turned out because it was both useful and visually pleasing to me. Also surprisingly resilient considering it was made of cardboard.
