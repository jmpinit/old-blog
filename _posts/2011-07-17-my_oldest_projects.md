A long time ago I had a [Google site](https://sites.google.com/site/bitwinproject/), before I had a server of my own to use. I posted many of my oldest projects there. During the time that I made those projects I didn't have the knowledge required to work intimately with the electronics of the junk that I was modifying, so most of the projects started out with lofty goals and ended with a piece of partially working mechanical art.

A good example is my [laser gun](https://sites.google.com/site/bitwinproject/young-projects/lasergun). It isn't really a laser gun at all, of course. It is really is just a very weak infrared flashlight built into a capgun so that it can be turned on with the trigger. I knew it probably wouldn't work from the start when I built it, but I built it anyway because the fun is in the attempt! It was an experiment with an unknown result, and I felt proud to carry it out even if I knew that it probably would not yield results. Besides, when I was done I had something much cooler than what I had started out with. A laser gun that you built, even if it only works with the help of some imagination, is infinitely more fun than a couple of batteries, a cap gun, and the guts of a remote.

When I was building these projects I was never disappointed, even though I almost never achieved what I had set out to. It was all about the process; going through the process was the real goal. I felt successful just for trying, because I looked at my friends and thought, "what new things are they trying to create? Nothing!" I really felt like I was adding to the world by creating things that had never existed before.

I still have the sense of joy in creating that I had back then. It's at the heart of my love for engineering and is the reason that I feel such passion for it. It's also why **I consider myself an artist first and an engineer second**. I want to have the skills of an engineer because it allows me to create wonderful things, but** I engineer things that _I _feel have meaning.**

So check out my old projects and tell me what you think, but keep in mind my motivations. Too often work like mine is dismissed as pointless because the end result does not fulfill a practical goal. If you look at them and feel the love that went into the building, _then_ their true purpose is fulfilled.
