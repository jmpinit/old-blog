I have moved for the summer to the state of Washington where I am working as an intern for Intellectual Ventures Lab. I am working with 3ric Johanson, but I can't say much beyond that. In late August I will be moving to Boston to go to college at M.I.T.

So if it is still the summer of 2012 while you are reading this, and my blog seems pretty dead, then the above reason is why.

P.S. - I am writing this on a bus, which is a part of the pretty awesome public transportation system here. But I have a one and a half hour commute. Yippee.
