Engineers do not tackle constructing their final product right from the start. Instead, they build a series of simpler constructions to prove the various systems that underlie the main project will work before putting them together into one coherent structure. These are the major prototypes that I think I will need to build before creating the final project:

* Wireless communications
* Trickle charging - store up energy from a weak source, like a solar panel, to do more than what could be done by continuously using the weak source
* Power measuring - How much is left? How much has been used?
* Power management system - How can we schedule power-hungry tasks so that they get done by the time they need to be done but not suck the power system dry?
* Distributed computing - How can tasks be shared most efficiently? Extremely broad area. The scope of this prototype will be narrowed as the other ones are finished.
* Remote repair - Enable the software systems to be reset and recalibrated from the 'ground' (an external device some distance away).
* Combined prototype - Put together the progress from the preceding prototype systems into one system: the first full ersat.

They are subject to change as I work through the project, and more might be added to the list. All will be as thoroughly documented as the final resulting creation.
