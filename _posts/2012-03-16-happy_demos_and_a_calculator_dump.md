Last week I received an extremely awesome and possibly life-changing opportunity. As a result I became a little feverish with excitement and stopped work on my long term projects. Instead I made a slew of short fun demos on my calculator and elsewhere. I'm going to take this as an opportunity to show the fun things that I've done with my calculator.

Here is a backup file containing what I've currently got on my TI-84+. It's nowhere near everything I've ever done (I'll post the rest when/if I find them), but it's a large chunk of what I've done on it this year and last year.
