* Desktop Turing Machine - I'm planning out this little desktop widget. It is a Turing Machine whose tape is tiny ball bearings. The bearings are moved around with electromagnets. It uses a BEAM robotics circuit to store up power from a solar panel in supercapacitors until there is enough to do one computational step (controlled by an MCU). I envision it just as a pretty thing to watch.
* Fan art - I've got a few dozen computer fans that I am mounting on my wall. Their speed will correspond to the rate of my commits to Github, and the rate at which I work through my todo list. I am hoping that it will create a positive feedback loop, making me get more things done by making me aware of the progress I am making.
* Z80 microcomputer from Tranz 330 POS terminal
* Reclaimed server blade
* Tiny wrist-worn display linked over Bluetooth to my phone. It's just an SMD [Attiny84](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11232), an [RN-42 Bluetooth module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10253), [Nokia 3310 LCD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168), a piezo electric element for tap input, and a [tiny polymer lithium ion battery](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11316). Will display the time like a regular watch, and also notifications from my phone as well as any other information I care to add. Currently in the drawn-all-over-my-arms-in-pen design stage. Need to find some money to buy the parts.
