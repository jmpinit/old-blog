From my old hackniac blog.

I just got my TI calculator UART code working almost perfectly, so I thought I would celebrate and make a nice touch screen mod for my calculator. It turns out that the Nintendo DS touch screen is an almost perfect size for the calculator, and you can just stick it's adhesive back to the screen and plug it in. The end goal is to have the control circuitry inside the calculator so the touch screen can be permanent. I'll be using an Attiny13 to read the touch screen data and transfer it over serial to the calculator which can do with it what it wants. Hopefully I'll be able to get some kind of photoshopish program written to make it a little bit more useful.

[edit: never fit the circuitry inside or wrote the photoshop program.]
