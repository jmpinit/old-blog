From my old hackniac blog.

About a month ago I started learning assembly programming for the z80 processor in the TI-83 plus and TI-84. One of the things that I had in mind to do with the new skill I was acquiring was giving the calculator the capability to communicate over its link port using Universal Asynchronous Transmit Receive (UART) protocol, which is used by many of the devices, modules, and integrated circuits that I use in my projects. Giving my calculator that ability would allow it use data from bluetooth, gps, SD card, and many other modules.

The project is complicated by two factors. The first is that the z80 processor doesn't really work well with UART in the state it is in inside the calculator, because I can't use interrupts to handle incoming data. This means that to receive data the calculator has to go into a very tight loop until data starts coming in, which can be a serious limitation. The second complication is the fact that the calculator executes less clock cycles per second as the batteries becomes weaker, which means that the timing has to be dynamic or it will become inaccurate as the batteries die.
