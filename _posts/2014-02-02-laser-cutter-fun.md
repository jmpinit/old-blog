A friend needed to get a gear cut out on the water jet CNC machine at CSAIL. There's also a laser cutter there that I usually don't have access to, so I grabbed my laptop and ran along with them. Made the design file on the way there. The job took forever and the power levels were completely wrong, but the result looks cool, and I learned new things about using laser cutters.
