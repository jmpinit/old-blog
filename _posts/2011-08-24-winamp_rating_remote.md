I have bajillions of chiptunes ([8bc.org](http://8bc.org) plug) and I use Winamp to organize and play them. Many songs are terrible (really, why did I download them?) so I've been using the rating system to cut out the good ones from the mediocre. The only problem is that I listen while working and it's annoying to stop what I am doing to rate a song, even though I need to do that constantly to churn through every song before the end of time.

I need a wireless remote that lets me rate the currently playing song on Winamp. Maybe I'll figure out how to work it into my [super watch](http://www.hackniac.com/posts/super-watch-post-mortem.html), or maybe I'll put it into a super remote or maybe it's a little silly and I'll let the idea go :P
