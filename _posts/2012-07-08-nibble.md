# Nibble: the retrocomputing cube

![](http://hackniac.com/images/posts/nibble/nibble_front.jpg)

Nibble is an attempt at bringing the joys of 8 bit computing hardware to the Internet in a friendly format. A small battery-powered cube contains an LCD screen, speaker, LEDs, IO port, and Bluetooth radio connected to an AVR microprocessor (a.k.a. Arduino chip). Over Bluetooth the cube communicates with Node.js. All basic functionality is exposed to Javascript via a simple API. Firmware can be loaded over the air or built-in high-level functions like toast notifications can be used.

## A Real DCPU16

A goal of Nibble is to serve as physical hardware for the made-up DCPU16 microprocessor from Notch's (of Minecraft fame) abandoned game 0x10c. While the game was being worked on I followed its community with great interest, because they were quickly developing numerous tools and applications for the made-up DCPU16 chip. The 0x10c programming scene was overflowing with enthusiasm and fun. So much development happened that GitHub added DCPU16 assembly as an official language. Channeling just a little bit of that fun into a physical object is a worthwhile endeavor in my view. 0x10c tapped into a widespread longing for approachable low-level programming fun that I believe should still see the light of day.
