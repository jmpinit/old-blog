I participated in Codeday MEGA put on in Redmond at Thinkspace by StudentRND. It was 30 hours of programming intended to produce either a mobile app or a game.

I rode my bike 45 minutes to get to Thinkspace and then set myself up comfortably inside in preparation for the competition. Within a short time I met a cool guy named Osmond who was willing to take on a game idea that I've been wanting to develop (Hackwire, which I have pursued before). We worked on that for maybe 20 of our 30 hours and then I basically decided it wasn't going to work out (thanks Osmond for tolerating my apparent ADD!).

We decided to take a shot at another idea. What we came up with was an implementation of the [Wikipedia game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game)Â that worked but didn't work because Wikipedia banned us for being a robot crawling their pages. It was really fun to attempt (we used Node.js which is almost always fun), but it burned another 8 hours.

Finally I came up with a stupid-simple multiplayer racing game that I called Derby. I feverishly wrote the code in Javascript using a combination of Node.js and HTML5 stuff, and Osmond made a track and cars that couldn't be used because we ran out of time (sorry man). Here's the video of my presentation of it, which didn't go particularly well because I hadn't slept for 30 hours and kind of rambled and forgot that I only had 3 minutes:


And here's the code!
