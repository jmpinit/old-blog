I've got at least a dozen ancient EPROMs lying around inside various pieces of junk or loose in my parts bins. They are not really useful to me for any particular purpose anymore because I don't have the equipment to write new data onto them so I have been thinking about ways to use them.

Obviously one of the most straightforward things to do with them is to dump them and see what kinds of goodies are on them. I'm intended to do that at some point, but I happened upon an idea that I think will be much more interesting. The data inside these EPROMs forms logical structures by its nature. It was put into the chip for a reason so it is lush with patterns to be parsed. I want to build something that can take the data inside of these chips and condense it down into a visual representation of its 'personality'. Some kind of image or sound that a human can easily understand that represents the contents of the chip as a whole.

Sound would be a fairly easy approach. In fact, it would be rather trivial to play out the data as sound samples and get a unique sound from each chip. That would be fun to do, but not complicated enough! I could feed it into an algorithm to put out melodies that sound pleasant to human ears, but that feels like cheating to me. It needs to keep the character of having been unseen mysterious data. A chirpy pleasant song would not have that quality. Plus, a guy by the name of Steve already did a [very similar project](http://www.bigmessowires.com/2011/05/06/mozarts-credit-card/) with credit cards.

Another approach would be to generate some kind of image out of the data. I'm a little more partial to that but it also seems like a cop-out because it's so easy to generate an image from data like this and there are so many different ways to do it. Again, it needs to convey the harsh quality of the data that it is representing.
