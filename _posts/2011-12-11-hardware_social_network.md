A very old idea of mine, but one that I was obsessed with for a very long time. The idea was to create cheap devices that could communicate over short distances wirelessly. People would wear them as necklaces or bracelets and go about their lives with them on. If two people wearing them were to come near each other information about each person would be shared and they each would be notified of the other person's existence. Of course it would be odd to meet new people this way, but the locators could notify you only if someone sharing your particular interests was nearby. That way they could make themselves useful. Unfortunately I did not have the time or the skills to make it when I was obsessed with the idea, and by now some major companies are doing the same thing (like[ this one](http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/07/magnetu-connects-you-with-similar-people-in-your-area-because-d/), for example).
