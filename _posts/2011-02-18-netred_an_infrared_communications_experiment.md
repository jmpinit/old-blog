I will continue to think about the project and refine these designs. Hopefully in the future I will have the time to do something with it. It might be a good candidate for a legacy I can leave behind at my school. I would love to leave a couple of the servers in hidden spots around the school and place some instructions somewhere for other kids to get access to it. The opportunity for a homebrew and underground network playground for young hackers is a cool idea that I would love not to let pass.
