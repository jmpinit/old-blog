From my old hackniac blog


![](http://hackniac.com/images/relic/engine.png)

My old blog engine was horrible. It was tough to maintain and difficult to write articles with. I am constructing this new system to allow my ideas to prosper more freely on the web.

It is set up like this: The whole thing is written in PHP. Every project has its own folder. In each folder is a series of text files that make up each part of the project. The PHP crunches that text so I don't have to write everything in HTML. It parses the files and displays it in the nice format you see before you now [edit: the format you would be seeing no longer exists. It is happily dead].

With time I am going to try and make it better. I still have to edit the text files on my computer and manually upload them to the server every time I want to make an update, which is a pain. At least now I can add stuff in little chunks and not worry about it looking partly finished. These are ongoing projects and that's the point, so I want a system that reflects that.
