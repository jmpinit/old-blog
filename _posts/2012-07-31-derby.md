Derby
=====

![derby]({{site.url}}/images/derby/derby.gif)

Proof-of-concept, in-browser, multiplayer, top-down racing game made using Node.js, Socket.io, and Hammer.js. Point a browser on one computer (preferably connected to a big screen) to /screen.html. Then each player visits the server on their phone and sees a steering wheel that allows them to control the new car made for them on the screen page.

Started during a Code Day hackathon (run by [StudentRND](http://studentrnd.org/)) in the summer of 2012.
