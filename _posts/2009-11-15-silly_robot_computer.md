From my old hackniac blog

I can't explain why this came to be. The other day I brought my ancient dead laptop back to life for the fourth time. I was thinking about turning it into a robot platform, but then today I saw a cardboard box in the trash. This crazy project just poofed into my head. Lo and behold the cardboard robot/tv computer.

Basically I took the guts of my laptop and taped them into a box. I cut a square hole for the screen. I made some nice stand-offs inside the box with cardboard for the actual computer. There are extra holes for the Wifi card, CD drive, and speakers. USB cables and other things get plugged in the back. I have a nice old keyboard and mouse to make it useable. Runs Windows XP, but I might have to switch to linux because I can't seem to find the activation code (damn you Microsoft).

I was just going to leave it as my laptop in a cardboard box but then my creative juices started flowing and I made it into a robot with old tv antennae and cardboard knobs with face drawn on in marker. He is an excellent addition to my technology family and I have a feeling we will become more attached to each other as time goes on.
