This summer I lived in the home of people who like the outdoors. Towards the end of my stay they took me out to Mt. Rainier. We spent a good portion of the day exploring some of the beautiful mountain, hiking a short loop and eating lunch by a mountain lake. When we were heading back to the place where we entered we ran into people who said that they saw a bear on the trail where they had come from and we were heading to. We kept going and soon found the bear. It came trundling out of the trees only a few dozen feet from us. One of the people I was with stayed put for a few seconds and managed to get a really great picture of the bear. The rest of us quickly walked further down the trail. The bear paid us little heed throughout the encounter, continuing its foraging uninterrupted.

I took a few pictures on the adventure, but unfortunately I only had my phone with me to take them, so they did not turn out as nice as they could have. Still, they give a sense of the beauty of the place.
