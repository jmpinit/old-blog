My concept for how I will use this device is rather odd I think compared to the usual techniques that other devices use. Most gadgets where a person is able to enter text have a screen so that the person can see what they are typing. I don't want to sacrifice the space, weight, or battery power needed for a screen so I got a little creative with the method for inputting text. A row of LED's and a small piezo-electric microphone are the sole providers of user feedback for the device. When you type there is a distinct pattern for every key displayed on the row of LED's and also a unique sound tied to every key. My hope is that with practice I will connect the sounds and patterns to the keys so that I can forgo the requirement of seeing what I am typing, I will hear it and read it in the patterns. 'Viewing' the text that I have written will simply require the pattern of sounds and lit LED's that correspond to each letter being played back to me for the text. It will likely be annoying at first but I believe the benefit is worth the cost, and it's not like anyone else is going to use this thing so it is O.K. if the interface is rather esoteric.
