This is a stunning visualization of both how DNA is wrapped up into a cell, and how it is copied by the molecular machinery in cells. All of my experiments with genetic algorithms and mimicking other biological processes in software, machinery, or art come from the wonder that the knowledge of such processes give me. It is not well known how amazing our bodies are on the microscopic level, with trillions of moving parts that can all work together for decades, withstanding flaws and attacks from both the outside and the inside. Learning about biology lets us see what can be accomplished in millions of years by random chance and the laws of physics. Learning about that process keeps me aware of how much more should be possible in much less time with my modern brain.
