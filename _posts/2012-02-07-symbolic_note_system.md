I'm reading a book called The Plague for my english class and it has triggered an idea for a new note-taking system. The book will be the source of an essay that I will have to write in a month, so I am taking detailed notes while reading it. At first I wrote them on paper, then I tried taking them digitally, but neither worked perfectly. Digital notes can be searched and indexed, but require a clunkier process than simply writing on paper. But paper notes are messy and hard to navigate. What I need is a fast and highly organized system.

The insight I've had involves making the computer 'understand' the notes, giving it the capability to make inferences about meaning that speed up the collection of information. To give a concrete example, my system would be able to recognize and properly respond to synonyms, so if Bob the butcher killed someone then a reference to "Bob" or "the butcher" would be understood to mean the same thing by the computer. This has been attempted by many people over the years, but I think I might be onto something with the way I'm planning on making it work. I think the trick is to take the fullest advantage of the human note-taker possible, and get them to do the tricky categorization on the fly. That way the problem turns into figuring out how to store the information and relationships within it, and having a user interface that is efficient.

I'm thinking about putting together some kind of prototype of this idea in the near future.
