[Nanomaker](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-s079-nanomaker-spring-2013/) is a hands-on class about nanotechnology that I'm taking here at MIT. So far we've made spectrometers, holograms, and electroluminescent pixels with cheap materials and equipment that could be found in any home. The E.L. pixel lab is my favorite so far, because the theory behind the operation seems so difficult to exploit (quantum tunnelling) but we managed to make a working device with minimal difficulty in under an hour.
