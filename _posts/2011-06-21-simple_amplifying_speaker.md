I love listening to music while I am working, but the only device I have to make the sounds is my netbook, which has horrible tiny speakers. Usually I steal the speakers from the family desktop PC, which have an amplifier built in, but of course my family does not like that. I finally got around to building a solution.

It's a simple creation, I just combined a speaker and amplifier circuit from my junk bin, but I like it because it solves the scarce-speaker problem and uses two pieces of junk that weren't being used for anything.

Although the amplifier is stereo the speaker is mono, so the combination is limited to mono. This is fine for my purposes. I just tied both channels together to flatten out music or audio that uses the channels differently.

I made a very small trick with how I combined the two parts to make it easier on myself. The amplifier had a cable that at some point went to an input jack, but had the jack itself lopped off. The speaker had an input jack of its own on a long cable. What I did was to disconnect the speaker input wire, pull it out of the hole in the speaker casing, thread the amplifier input wire out of the same hole in the speaker casing from the inside, and then solder the amplifier input wire to the original speaker input wire to make one longer cable. A short length of shrink-tube and a small piece of tape made the connection sound.

On the amplifier circuit there was an on/off button and a power indicator LED. Originally I was going to break these out to the speaker casing so I could access them once everything was closed up, but one look at the button wiring changed that plan. It is some kind of complicated multi-stage, two-state button that launches different elements in the circuit as it is depressed. If it were a simple two-wire switch then I definitely would have gone through the trouble, but right now it is fine to have it permanently depressed with the power controlled by plugging/unplugging the amplifier at the outlet. As for the LED, maybe at some point I'll open the speaker back up and extend that to the casing, but it doesn't really matter to me much to see whether the speaker is getting power because if I can hear it then I know it is. I did disconnect the LED and throw it into my parts bin, it's not useful just leaving it inside the speaker.

For volume control I simply drilled a hole in the casing of the speaker and positioned the amplifier circuit so that its volume knob would stick out. It's not the best solution and looks a little odd, but it works fine and is surprisingly easy to use (I was worried that too little knob would be sticking out or it would get caught on the edges of the hole). Like the button, I was going to break out the volume control to a position on the speaker case, but it was a complex type of potentiometer that I did not want to desolder and extend with wires.

I also burned myself.
